# Data Science Project: NBA Dashboard

This repository hosts the Data Science Project (DS500) of Finn Höner and Tim-Moritz Bündert.
It contains all the commented code associated with the project along with the corresponding data.

The dashboard is hosted on [this website](http://193.196.53.114/).

Larger data files can be accessed on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nl-O5oP8OEU6t839dVkCwwlSNc3XAY1e?usp=sharing).

## Structure
Different subfolders and their purposes:

### data
Contains datafiles, optionally odered in more subfolders for different applications. We should pay attention, if there is a potential to make use of multiple dataset jointly.

### assets
Later on this can be used for style elements such as `.css` files or images.

### notes
Folder containing notes in `.md` format and their generated PDFs.

### noteboooks
Jupyter `.ipynb` notebooks to try stuff out and for coding ideas.

### src
Folder for source code, i.e. here we can specify python modules
