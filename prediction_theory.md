# Distribution
- Poisson distribution? Problem is, that scores do not have the same unit e.g. 3pts and 2 pts
  - Assumptions like no streakiness or constant rate over time could be argues for, see `gabel_2012`
- For Plus-Minus we should use a Skellam distribution?
  - Possible advantage: Mass under the distribution that is right of x=0 can be interpreted as probability to win?
